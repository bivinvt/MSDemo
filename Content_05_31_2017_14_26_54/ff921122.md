The **EventAggregator** service is primarily a container for events that allow decoupling of publishers and subscribers so they can evolve independently. This decoupling is useful in modularized applications because new modules can be added that respond to events defined by the shell or, more likely, other modules.

In the Composite Application Library, **EventAggregator** allows subscribers or publishers to locate a specific **EventBase**. The event aggregator also allows for multiple publishers and multiple subscribers, as shown in Figure 1.

IEventAggregator
================

The **EventAggregatorÂ **class is offered as a service in the container and can be retrieved through the **IEventAggregator** interface. The event aggregator is responsible for locating or building events and for keeping a collection of the events in the system.

    public interface IEventAggregator
    {        
       TEventType GetEvent<TEventType>() where TEventType : EventBase;
    }

The **EventAggregator** will construct the event on its first access if it has not already been constructed. This relieves the publisher or subscriber from needing to determine whether the event is available.

CompositeWpfEvent
=================

The real work of connecting publishers and subscribers is done by the **CompositeWpfEvent** class. This is the only implementation of the **EventBase** class that comes out of the box in the Composite Application Library. This class maintains the list of subscribers and handles event dispatching to the subscribers.

The **CompositeWpfEvent** class is a generic class that requires the payload type to be defined as the generic type. This helps enforce, at compile time, that publishers and subscribers provide the correct methods for successful event connection. The following code shows a partial definition of the **CompositeWpfEvent** class.

    public class CompositeWpfEvent<TPayload> : EventBase
    {
        
        public SubscriptionToken Subscribe(Action<TPayload> action);
        public SubscriptionToken Subscribe(Action<TPayload> action, 
               ThreadOption threadOption);
        public virtual SubscriptionToken Subscribe(Action<TPayload> action, 
              ThreadOption threadOption, bool keepSubscriberReferenceAlive, 
              Predicate<TPayload> filter);
        public virtual void Publish(TPayload payload);
        public virtual void Unsubscribe(Action<TPayload> subscriber);
        public virtual void Unsubscribe(SubscriptionToken token);
        
    }

The **CompositeWpfEvent** is intended to be the base class for an application's or module's specific events. For example, the following code shows the **TickerSymbolSelectedEvent** in the Stock Trader Reference Implementation (Stock Trader RI).

    public class TickerSymbolSelectedEvent : CompositeWpfEvent<string>{}

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In a composite application, the events are frequently shared between multiple modules so are defined in a common place. In the Stock Trader RI, this is done in the **StockTraderRI.Infrastructure** project. |

Subscribing to an Event
-----------------------

Subscribers can enlist with an event using one of the **CompositeWpfEvent** available **Subscribe** method overloads. There are a number of options for subscribing to **CompositeWpfEvents**. Use the following criteria to help determine which option best suits your needs:

-   If you need to be able to update user-interface elements when an event is received, [subscribe to receive the event on the user interface thread](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ff921122(v=pandp.40)#_Subscribing_on_the).
-   If you need to filter an event, [provide a filter delegate when subscribing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ff921122(v=pandp.40)#_Subscription_filtering).
-   If you have noticed performance concerns with your events, consider [using strongly-referenced delegates when subscribing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ff921122(v=pandp.40)#_Subscribing_with_strong) and manually [unsubscribe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ff921122(v=pandp.40)#_Unsubscribing_from_an) from the **CompositeWpfEvent**.
-   If none of the preceding is applicable, use a [default subscription](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ff921122(v=pandp.40)#_Default_Subscriptions).

<span id="_Default_Subscriptions"><span></span></span>
Default Subscriptions
---------------------

For a minimal or default subscription, the subscriber must provide a callback method with the appropriate signature that receives the event notification. For example, the handler for the **TickerSymbolSelectedEvent** requires the method take a string parameter, as shown here.

    public void Initialize()
    {
       eventAggregator.GetEvent<TickerSymbolSelectedEvent>().Subscribe(ShowNews);
    }

    public void ShowNews(string companySymbol)
    {
       articlePresentationModel.SetTickerSymbol(companySymbol);
    }

<span id="_Subscribing_on_the"><span></span></span><span id="_Ref201457705"><span></span></span>
Subscribing on the User Interface Thread
----------------------------------------

Frequently, subscribers will need to update user interface elements in response to events. In Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), only a UI thread can update user interface elements. By default, the subscriber receives the event on the publisher's thread so if the publisher sends the event from the UI thread, the subscriber will be able to update the user interface.

However, if the publisher's thread is a background thread, the subscriber may be unable to directly update user interface elements. Instead, it would need to schedule the updates on the UI thread using the Windows Presentation Foundation's **Dispatcher** class. The **CompositeWpfEvent** provided with the Composite Application Library can assist by allowing the subscriber to automatically receive the event on the UI thread. The subscriber must indicate this during subscription, as shown in the following code.

    public void Initialize()
    {
       eventAggregator.GetEvent<TickerSymbolSelectedEvent>().Subscribe(ShowNews,
                                                          ThreadOption.UIThread);
    );
    }

    public void ShowNews(string companySymbol)
    {
       articlePresentationModel.SetTickerSymbol(companySymbol);
    }

The following options are available for **ThreadOption**:

-   **Publisher**. Use this setting to receive the event on the publishers' thread. This is the default setting.
-   **Background**. Use this setting to receive the event on a .NET Framework thread-pool thread.
-   **UIThread**. Use this setting to receive the event on the user interface thread.

<span id="_Subscription_filtering"><span></span></span><span id="_Ref201457712"><span></span></span>
Subscription Filtering
----------------------

Subscribers may not need to handle every instance of a published event. In these cases, the subscriber can subscribe and supply a delegate that filters the event before the registered handler is called. Frequently, this filter is supplied as a lambda expression, as shown in the following code.

    FundAddedEvent fundAddedEvent = eventAggregator.GetEvent<FundAddedEvent>();

    fundAddedEvent.Subscribe(FundAddedEventHandler, 
                             ThreadOption.UIThread, false,
                             fundOrder => fundOrder.CustomerId == _customerId);

<span id="_Subscribing_with_strong"><span></span></span><span id="_Ref201457719"><span></span></span>
Subscribing Using Strong References
-----------------------------------

If you have noticed performance concerns with your events, you may need to subscribe with strong delegate referencesâ€”and therefore manually unsubscribe from the eventâ€”instead of the default weak delegate references maintained by **CompositeWpfEvent**.

By default,**Â CompositeWpfEvent** maintains a weak delegate reference to the subscriber's handler and filter on subscription. This means the reference that **CompositeWpfEvent** holds to the subscriber will not prevent garbage collection of the subscriber. Using a weak delegate reference relieves the subscriber from the need to unsubscribe to enable proper garbage collection. However, maintaining this weak delegate reference is slower than a corresponding strong delegate reference. For most applications, this performance will not be noticeable, but if your application publishes a large number of events in a short period of time, you may need to use strong delegate references with **CompositeWpfEvent** to achieve reasonable performance. If you do use strong delegate references, your subscriber should unsubscribe to enable proper garbage collection of your subscribing object.

To subscribe with a strong reference, use the **keepSubscriberReferenceAlive** option on the **Subscribe** method, as shown in the following code.

    FundAddedEvent fundAddedEvent = eventAggregator.GetEvent<FundAddedEvent>();

    bool keepSubscriberReferenceAlive = true;

    fundAddedEvent.Subscribe(FundAddedEventHandler, 
                             ThreadOption.UIThread, keepSubscriberReferenceAlive,
                             fundOrder => fundOrder.CustomerId == _customerId);

<span id="_Ref201457730"><span></span></span>
Publishing an Event
-------------------

Publishers raise an event by retrieving the event from the **EventAggregator** and calling the **Publish** method. For example, the following code demonstrates publishing the **TickerSymbolSelectedEvent**.

    EventAggregator.GetEvent<TickerSymbolSelectedEvent>().Publish(e.Value);

<span id="_Unsubscribing_from_an"><span></span></span><span id="_Ref201457741"><span></span></span><span id="_Ref201457780"><span></span></span>
Unsubscribing from an Event
---------------------------

If your subscriber no longer wants to receive events, you can unsubscribe using your subscriber's handler directly or you can unsubscribe by using a subscription token. The following example shows how to directly unsubscribe to the handler.

        compositeWpfEvent.Subscribe(
            FundAddedEventHandler,
            ThreadOption.PublisherThread);

        compositeWpfEvent.Unsubscribe(FundAddedEventHandler);

To unsubscribe with a subscription token, the token supplied during the subscribe process can be supplied to the **Unsubscribe** method call, as shown here.

    FundAddedEvent fundAddedEvent = eventAggregator.GetEvent<FundAddedEvent>();

    subscriptionToken = fundAddedEvent.Subscribe(FundAddedEventHandler,   
                                      ThreadOption.UIThread, false,
                                      fundOrder => fundOrder.CustomerId == _customerId);

    fundAddedEvent.Unsubscribe(subscriptionToken);
